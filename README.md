# PharmTool
This project is a MVP for a patient - healthcare practitioner interface.   
It provides an easy to use platform for healthcare professionals to keep track of their diabetic patients' history.

Diabetic Patients are able to record their blood sugar readings, and any other required information on the platform.
Healthcare professionals are able to view these records and make inferences on the patients' condition.
They can then make recommendations, referrals and prescriptions based on the patients' background & history.

A trial run for this tool was conducted at the Kenyatta National Hospital in 2021, and received favourable feedback from both patients and medics.

The tool was developed primarily for Diabetes Patients, but is to be extended in scope.
A GA application is currently under developement.

`Pharmtool` is an experimental name.
